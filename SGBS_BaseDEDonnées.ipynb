    "# Bases de données relationnelle\n",
    "\n",
    "    #Un système de gestion de base de données (abr. SGBD) est un logiciel système servant à stocker, à manipuler ou gérer, et à partager des données dans une base de données, en garantissant la qualité, la pérennité et la confidentialité des informations, tout en cachant la complexité des opérations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #Un SGBD (en anglais DBMS pour database management system) permet d'inscrire, de retrouver, de modifier, de trier, de transformer ou d'imprimer les informations de la base de données. Il permet d'effectuer des comptes rendus des informations enregistrées et comporte des mécanismes pour assurer la cohérence des informations, éviter des pertes d'informations dues à des pannes, assurer la confidentialité et permettre son utilisation par d'autres logiciels. Selon le modèle, le SGBD peut comporter une simple interface graphique jusqu'à des langages de programmation sophistiqués.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #Il existe essentiellement deux grande familles de SGBD: relationnel et non relationnel, également appelé SQL et NoSQL. Ils diffèrent en termes d'extraction, de distribution et de traitement des données.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Relationnel ou SQL. \n",
    "    Puisqu'un langage de requête structuré est le noyau du systèmes, ce type de base de données est également appelé SQL pour “Structured Query Language” in english. Dans les SGBD relationnels, les données apparaissent sous forme de tableaux de lignes et de colonnes avec une structure rigide, avec des dépendances claires.\n",
    "    En raison de la structure intégrée et du système de stockage des données, les bases de données SQL ne nécessitent pas beaucoup de travail additionnel pour être bien protégées. Ils constituent un bon choix pour la création et la prise en charge de solutions logicielles complexes, où toute interaction a de nombreuses conséquences. L'un des principes fondamentaux de SQL est la conformité ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). La conformité ACID est une option intéressante si vous créez, par exemple, des applications e-commerce ou dans le secteur financier, dans lesquelles l’intégrité de la base de données est essentielle.\n",
    "    Cependant, la croissance peut être un défi avec les bases de données SQL. La mise à l'échelle d'une base de données SQL entre plusieurs serveurs (mise à l'échelle horizontale) nécessite des efforts d'ingénierie supplémentaires. Au lieu de cela, les bases de données SQL sont généralement mises à l'échelle verticalement, c'est-à-dire en ajoutant plus de puissance de calcul à un serveur. Ici, nous allons discuter de plusieurs bases de données SQL:\n",
    "        • MySQL\n",
    "        • MariaDB\n",
    "        • Oracle\n",
    "        • PostgreSQL\n",
    "        • MSSQL\n",
    "## Non relationnel ou NoSQL.\n",
    "    Comme ces bases de données ne sont pas limitées à une structure de table, elles s'appellent NoSQL. Ce type de système de gestion de base de données est considéré comme orienté document. Les données non structurées (telles que les articles, les photos, les vidéos et autres) sont assemblées dans un seul document. Les données sont simples à interroger, mais ne sont pas toujours classées en lignes et en colonnes comme dans une base de données relationnelle. Les bases de données non relationnelles ou NoSQL sont généralement mises à l'échelle horizontalement en ajoutant des serveurs.\n",
    "    Étant donné que les bases de données NoSQL permettent de compiler plusieurs types de données ensemble et de les redimensionner en se développant autour de plusieurs serveurs, leur popularité ne cesse de décroître. En outre, la création d'une preuve de concept (POC) est une excellente option pour les startups utilisant une méthode Agile. Le NoSQL ne nécessite aucune préparation préalable au déploiement, ce qui facilite les mises à jour rapides et sans délai de la base de données.\n",
    "    Nous détaillerons ici les de bases de données NoSQL les plus populaires telles que:\n",
    "        • MongoDB\n",
    "        • Cassandra\n",
    "        • Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Le NewSQL\n",
    "    est une architecture qui reprend les avantages du NoSQL et comble son principal désavantage. Il palie à l'éventuel cohérence des données de ce dernier grâce au support de transaction ACID via un langage unique de requétage le SQL. Il est aussi jeune qu'il est plein de promesses. Voici ci-dessous quelques-unes de ces caractéristiques:  Le SQL comme langage commun de requétage  Transaction ACID  Un mécanisme qui évite la pause de verrous lors d'opérations concurrentes de lecture avec les opérations d'écritures. La lecture en temps réel en est ainsi facilitée.  Une architecture qui a de meilleures performances par nœud que les solutions classiques de type SGBDR.  Scalabilité horizontale, architecture sans maître et capable de tourner sur un nombre important de nœuds sans souffrir de goulot d'étranglement. Architecture distribuée.  Base de données en mémoire. Au vu de ce qui précède, on peut raisonnablement \"penser\" que ce type d'architecture sera celle adoptée demain en entreprise.\n",

    "La conception d'un système d'information n'est pas évidente car il faut réfléchir à l'ensemble de l'organisation que l'on doit mettre en place. La phase de conception nécessite des méthodes permettant de mettre en place un modèle sur lequel on va s'appuyer. La modélisation consiste à créer une représentation virtuelle d'une réalité de telle façon à faire ressortir les points auxquels on s'intéresse. Ce type de méthode est appelé analyse. Il existe plusieurs méthodes d'analyse, la méthode la plus utilisée en France étant la méthode MERISE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Présentation de la méthode MERISE\n",
    "MERISE est une méthode de conception, de développement et de réalisation de projets informatiques. Le but de cette méthode est d'arriver à concevoir un système d'information. La méthode MERISE est basée sur la séparation des données et des traitements à effectuer en plusieurs modèles conceptuels et physiques. La séparation des données et des traitements assure une longévité au modèle. En effet, l'agencement des données n'a pas à être souvent remanié, tandis que les traitements le sont plus fréquemment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cycle d'abstraction de conception des systèmes d'information\n",
    "La conception du système d'information se fait par étapes, afin d'aboutir à un système d'information fonctionnel reflétant une réalité physique. Il s'agit donc de valider une à une chacune des étapes en prenant en compte les résultats de la phase précédente. D'autre part, les données étant séparées des traitements, il faut vérifier\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### L'expression des besoins est une étape consistant à définir ce que l'on attend du système d'information automatisé, il faut pour cela :\n",
    "    • faire l'inventaire des éléments nécessaires au système d'information\n",
    "    • délimiter le système en s'informant auprès des futurs utilisateurs\n",
    "\n",
    "Cela va permettre de créer le MCC (Modèle conceptuel de la communication) qui définit les flux d'informations à prendre en compte.L'étape suivante consiste à mettre au point le MCD (Modèle conceptuel des données) et le MCT (Modèle conceptuel des traitements) décrivant les règles et les contraintes à prendre en compte.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Le modèle organisationnel consiste à définir le MOT (Modèle organisationnel des traitements) décrivant les contraintes dues à l'environnement (organisationnel, spatial et temporel).\n",
